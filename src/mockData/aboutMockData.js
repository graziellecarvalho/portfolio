  content: '<p>Starting my journey in tech as a Quality Assurance professional was a pivotal moment, one I\'m grateful for every day. It gave me a solid foundation and a peek into various aspects of the field, like CMS, SEO, Accessibility, and Performance. Working closely with developers, project managers, and clients, I honed not just technical skills but also interpersonal ones.</p><p>However, as time went on, I began to question my long-term trajectory in QA. When the opportunity arose to transition into a Front-end developer role, I seized it without hesitation. I dedicated two days to intensive study of JavaScript and an additional three days to complete the necessary test, ultimately earning the title of Front-end developer.</p><p>Now, I specialize in <span>ReactJS</span> with <span>TypeScript</span>, focusing on crafting <span>user interfaces</span> that are not just functional but accessible to all. I have a keen eye for design and obsess over every detail, ensuring the end product is top-notch in performance and aesthetics.</p><p>Outside of work, you\'ll find me with my nose buried in a book, spending quality time with my husband and family, exploring the vibrant streets of New York City, or fighting against Fulings in Valheim.</p>',
